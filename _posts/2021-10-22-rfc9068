title: "RFC 9068: JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens"

The newly published "JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens" ([RFC 9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068)) is a valuable standards reference
for our use of JWTs with OAuth for interoperable, least-privilege resource access in scientific collaborations.
RFC 9068 includes guidance about issuing the "aud", "scope", "groups", "roles", and "entitlements" claims, about using the "resource" parameter in requests, 
and about validating tokens.
It also addresses important security and privacy considerations.
Work is already underway to align existing
[SciTokens](https://scitokens.org) and [WLCG](https://github.com/WLCG-AuthZ-WG/common-jwt-profile) profiles with this new standard.
