Panel: Migrating to Token-Based AuthN and AuthZ

December 6, 2022, 1:40-2:30pm (MST, UTC -7:00)

Several major research and education (R&E) HPC centers and international
HPC consortia are migrating from legacy authentication infrastructures to
token-based authentication and authorization methods.

The Workshops on Token Based Authentication and Authorization, hosted by
TAGPMA and the NSF-funded SciAuth project, have brought together several
stakeholders, developers, and implementors of token-based authentication
and authorization infrastructure, to present and compare their migration
efforts under way, and to promote common, interoperable methods. Workshop
participants were invited to present their current work in this panel, to
broaden awareness of these significant changes under way in
authentication, authorization and identity (AAI) infrastructure for R&E,
and to encourage participation and collaboration in standards development
and interoperability assurance for token-based AAI deployments.

Panelists Tom Dack (UKRI STFC, WLCG), Jim Basney (CILogon, SciAuth,
SciTokens, LIGO), and Jeny Teheran (Fermilab) summarized the migration
efforts in their projects to date, to present lessons learned and future
plans, and to discuss best practices for interoperability. Derek Simmel
(TAGPMA, PSC) chaired the panel session.
