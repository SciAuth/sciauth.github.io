The goal of the SciAuth project is to improve the usability and interoperability of the security credentials that scientists use to access NSF cyberinfrastructure, thereby improving the productivity of the many scientific collaborations supported by NSF cyberinfrastructure. SciAuth does not propose a new credential mechanism for NSF cyberinfrastructure, but rather it provides community engagement, support for coordinated adoption of community standards, assistance with software integration, security analysis and threat modeling, training, and workforce development to enable improved interoperability and usability for security credentials across NSF cyberinfrastructure. SciAuth aims to help the community realize the benefits of an interoperable, capability-based ecosystem when transitioning between credential technologies.

Usable mechanisms for privilege management are critical for enabling productive scientific collaborations across a diverse and distributed scientific cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. The [SciTokens](https://scitokens.org) project demonstrated that the use of JWTs with the IETF OAuth standard for privilege delegation provides a breakthrough for interoperable, least-privilege resource sharing in scientific collaborations. Now our challenge is to make that breakthrough technology usable by scientists across disciplines, project sizes, and software ecosystems by enabling coordinated deployments across cyberinfrastructures in active use today.
